## Assignment 1: HMMs (Hidden Markov Models)

Implement some problems of HMMs, i.e. the evaluation, decoding and learning problem. You are furthermore required to investigate HMMs in empirical and theoretical terms. In the final assignment,you are required to apply your knowledge to an applied problem setting. We provide you with observations of the direction of flight of different birds over time. The task is to develop a system that can determine different bird species based on their flying pattern and to shoot the birds.
